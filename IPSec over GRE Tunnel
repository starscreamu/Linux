apt install libreswan -y

#First edit the text file /etc/ipsec.conf in you favorite text editor, I use Vim. It should look something like this:

config setup
strictctlpolicy=yes
uniqueids=no

conn starscream_tunnel        #any name 
 left=10.10.10.1         #Outside interface of this router also gre tunnel ip addresses
 right=30.30.30.2        #Outside interface of the cisco router also gre tunnel ip addresses
 ike=aes256-sha1
 phase2alg=aes256-sha1 
 authby=secret
 auto=start
 type=transport #Corresponds to cisco transform set "mode"
 pfs=yes
 
#I use transport mode for less overhead, although you can use tunnel mode if you want. Just make sure all parameters on both sides match. Notice there is no policy to specify subnets to traverse the tunnel, the routing table determines that. Hence, route-based tunnel.

#Then edit the /etc/ipsec.secrets text file, it should look like this:

10.10.10.1 30.30.30.2 : PSK '12345'

#Finally, restart libreswan to load your configuration.

ipsec restart

ipsec status

Same on the second router.
