sudo modprobe ip_gre
lsmod | grep gre

And you should see:

ip_gre                 #####  0
gre                    #####  1 ip_gre
If you see something else it's possible that your kernel does not support GRE.

To forward all the traffic in and out of the GRE tunnel we're going to use iptables and iproute2 that should be already installed in all the major linux distributions. In case they're not installed use the following command

for Debian based distros:
sudo apt install iptables iproute2


for Red Hat based distros:
sudo yum install iptables iproute2

Step 2 - Tunnel setup
First we have to set up our tunnel.

On Server A execute this code to enable ip forwarding:

sudo echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p

Now create a new networking interface which will be the one using the GRE tunnel:

sudo ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre local 198.51.100.1 remote 203.0.113.1 ttl 255
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/30 dev gre1
sudo ip link set gre1 up

Then, do the same on Server B changing the IPs:

sudo ip tunnel add gre1 mode gre local 203.0.113.1 remote 198.51.100.1 ttl 255
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.2/30 dev gre1
sudo ip link set gre1 up

/etc/rc.local and add all the commands we did (except for the echo ones!) before the exit 0.

Step 2.1 - Ping test
On Server A do:

ping 10.0.0.2

And on Server B do:

ping 10.0.0.1

NAT is used to pass data over our GRE and out the other end.

On Server A run:

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/30 ! -o gre+ -j SNAT --to-source 198.51.100.1

On Server A run this commands to allow all the data going to and coming from Server B:

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 10.0.0.2 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.0.0.2 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
Then, we want to forward all our data from Server A to Server B.

Execute on Server A:

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 198.51.100.1 -p PROTO -m PROTO --dport PORT -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2
replacing PROTO and PORT with your actual ones.

For example, to forward all the data to a Webserver (Port TCP 80) we have to run:

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 198.51.100.1 -p TCP -m TCP --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.0.0.2

On a server restart all the things we did will be wiped out. To make sure the GRE tunnel and everything else is going to work after a restart we have to edit the file 
/etc/rc.local and add all the commands before exit 0.
